<p>I am a game programmer; studying currently an MSCS at DigiPen.</p>

<p>My expertise is in image processing, computer graphics and game development.</p>
<p>
	Some of my projects can be found in my <a href="/Portfolio/Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I have also published recently an article in IEEE entitled <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7222843&filter%3DAND(p_IS_Number%3A7222827)">Characterization of Nanotube Structures Using Digital-Segmented Images</a>, about using image processing to measure the thickness of nanotubes.

	Last semester I had the oportunity to work in a new video games which uses Oculus. 
	I was the platform engineer in this project, working with the Oculus integration using the C++ SDK, 
	the user experience as a game designer, level design with an Oculus development in mind, the Windows System, 
	Particle System and the Scripting System using LUA, with automatic reloading of scripts in real time (on debug) for faster development.

<p>
This semester I am working on a platform game using Unreal Engine 4. I am the graphics programmer, developing every single material and even some of the 3D models using blender.
For this role, I have experimented with procedural textures, postprocessing for outline effects and other cool effects for the graphics. 
</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy working hard, making video games, researching and getting along with everyone.</p>
