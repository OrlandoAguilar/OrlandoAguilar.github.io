        		<h1>Hi, I'm Orlando Aguilar Vivanco!</h1>
				<p>I am a game programmer; studying currently an MSCS at DigiPen with a focus in Game Development and graphics.</p>
                
                <p>My expertise is in image processing and game development.</p>
                <p>
                    Leader and designer of several tasks in programming projects, some of them can be found in my <a href="/Portfolio/Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also published recently an article in IEEE entitled <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7222843&filter%3DAND(p_IS_Number%3A7222827)">Characterization of Nanotube Structures Using Digital-Segmented Images</a>, about using image processing to measure the thickness of nanotubes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have successfully applied image processing techniques to video games in physics and graphics.

                    Currently I am working in a new video games which uses oculus. I am the platform engineer in this project, I have worked in the graphics engine, the windows system, the scripting and the oculus integration. Besides, I am one of the game designers in this project, working with another very good designer five programmers one 2D artist and one sound designer.
