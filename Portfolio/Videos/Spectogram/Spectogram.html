    <p>This project is able to take a signal as input and display the spectrogram of such signal.</p>
   
    <p>The project was made in Matlab using wavelets to analyse the signal through the time and frequency spaces. This project is able to take signals from sounds and special files.</p>

    <p>My goal in this project was to work with other 3 people to design the algorithms and develop the application.</p>
