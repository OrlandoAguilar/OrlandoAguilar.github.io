    <p>This is a dual project: A custom component-based engine developed in C++ and a videogame.</p>

    <p>During the development of the engine. I was in charge of the design and programming of the following systems:</p>

    <p>Scripting system (using Lua). My part was to learn how to use this language, to integrate the interpreter in the engine and to teach the team how to use the scripting system, how to wrap the engine functionality and how to use Lua for the prototypes and the game.</p>

    <p>Physics system. I have been developing the entire physics system from scratch. Currently is able to calculate the new position an rotation by using Newtonian integration. I also developed the routines for collisions and the components and resources of the system.</p>

    <p>Windows system. This system was created using SDL to allow for compatibility with several SOs.</p>

    <p>Sound system. I worked with the first version of the Sound system using FMOD.</p>

    <p>Graphics system. In this system, I developed the part of texture creation and loading. I also wrote from scratch a parser for the 3d models (format OBJ with support for multiple objects and materials). Besides, I had the opportunity to develop code for the shaders.</p>

    <p>Other. I also modeled and textured all the models of the game using Blender.</p>
