    <h1>Path-finding using JPS+ and A* on map created from camera (C++, OpenCV)</h1>

    <p>In this project, a group of 5 people and me created a software able to take a photo with the camera of a laptop and generate a map that can be used in pathfinding.</p>
    <p>During this project I was in charge of the design of the algorithm for recognizing the map.</p>
    <p>The project uses the following technologies:</p>

    <div class="listTechnologies">
        <ul>
            <li>OpenCV</li>
            <li>DirectX</li>
            <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The next techniques of image processing were used:</p>
    <div class="listTechnologies">
        <ul>
            <li>Average of images (to eliminate noise)</li>
            <li>Smoothing by parts (to keep edges but smooth homogeneous parts)</li>
            <li>Morphological mathematics (to fill holes in binary image)</li>
            <li>Otsu (to calculate a global threshold)</li>
            <li>Local Threshold based in Gaussian functions (to calculate a local threshold)</li>
            <li>Point to point OR operation (to combine the result of both thresholds)</li>
            <li>Thinning with Zhang and Suen (to make all lines of just one pixel width)</li>
            <li>Polygonal approximation (improve quality of map)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        The project was also able to recognize some figures by mean of neural networks using the output of the polygonal approximation.</p>

    <p>
        Some of the algorithms were developed in C++, others were taken from the OpenCV library.
