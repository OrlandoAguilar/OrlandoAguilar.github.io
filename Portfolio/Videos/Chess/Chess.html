        This project was my first approach to the java language and the object oriented paradigm.
        The goal of the project was to design and develop a game using the standard API of java.
        The game can be played in three different modes:
    </p>
    <div class="listTechnologies">
        <ul>
            <li>Against AI: for this mode, I created a simple artificial intelligence to play against the player.</li>
            <li>Against another player in the same PC: the game was to be played against another person using the same screen.</li>
            <li>Against another player in local network: Using sockets, the game could be played in two different computers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        Technologies:
    </p>
    <div class="listTechnologies">
        <ul>
            <li>Java (Sockets, sounds, images, input and UI)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
