        During this project, I had the opportunity to work with other two programmers and some people of the area of Literature to develop an electronic and interactive version of a book. The project was developed as several pages, each page with a part of the story of the original book and a little videogame with the characters of the book.

        My team and me worked programming the software and creating the graphics.

        The technologies used in this project were:

        <ul>
            <li>BennuGD</li>
            <li>Chipmunk physics engine</li>
        </ul>
    </div>



    <p>
        My role in the development was to create the physics interaction and 1/3 of the pages of the book.
        The team took the role of artists, programmers and also designers; although the designers part was shared with the people of the area of literature in the University.
