    <p>This software was designed to help nutritionists to keep track of their diets and their patients. In this solo project, I designed the data base to work with Derby (<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">http://db.apache.org/derby/</a>). Also, designed the interface of the program and developed it using java. The program was designed to work in Mac, but because of the technologies that were used, it ended up running in the SOs where java runs.</p>
